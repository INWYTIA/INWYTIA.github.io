# Portfolio

This website is designed to clearly and concisely communicate who I am and what I am capable of as a web developer.  The index page is a simple introduction to me.  The portfolio page displays my projects and allows viewers to visit and experience them.  The contact page provides a means to reach out to me via email and open conversation or simply ask questions as necessary.
